# Every time you make a change, you should add a line to this file, along with a prefix to tag what sort of change it was (BUGFIX/FEATURE/BREAKING).
# Each time a release is created, the changes will be moved from this file into the changelog. The type of changes included in a release determine what happens to its version number:
# - If any BREAKING changes are included, a new major version will be released
# - If no BREAKING changes are included, but there are one or more FEATUREs, a new minor version will be released
# - Otherwise only the patch version of the release will be incremented
#
# Examples:
#
# BUGFIX: Fixed widget rendering [JIRA-123]
# FEATURE: Added gadget info screen [JIRA-456]
# BREAKING: Change API schema [JIRA-789]
